# Machine learning works 1.0 ðŸ¤–
A project to perform machine learning models using data science and machine learning tools such as Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib and try to figure out properties from a hospital's diabetes treatement database. This project was created using a virtual environment and it is highly recommendable to also use one in your computer, so please consider the 'requirements.txt' file to facilitate the work of compiling the necessary modules for the correct functioning of your project through PyPi without risking the integrity of your root environment. It is also important that you add the venv kernel to IPython through the virtual environment to check the analysis. All rights of use and reproduction of the data used in this study are owned by UCI. Thank you very much for your attention!
